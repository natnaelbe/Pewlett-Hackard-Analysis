## The CSV files appear to be organized and written in great detail.
## It appears from the list of names that men outweigh the field of engineering than women.
## A great majority of the employee names appear to be foreigners.
# Summary
## Based on the retiring titles table, plenty of shoes need to be filled in light of the fact that more than 25,000 senior engineers are retiring.
## There does not appear to be enough retirement ready employees to mentor because as said before, there are more than 25,000 senior level engineers retiring and out of the existing eligible members, there are more than 1,500 employees. This is much fewer than the total amount of people who are retiring.
